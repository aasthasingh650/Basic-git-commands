- About
The UNIX vi editor is a full screen editor and has two modes of operation:
1. Command mode commands which cause action to be taken on the file, and
2. Insert mode in which entered text is inserted into the file.
> In the command mode, every character typed is a command that does something to the text file being edited; a character typed in the command mode may even cause the vi editor to enter the insert mode. In the insert mode, every character typed is added to the text in the file; pressing the <Esc> (Escape) key turns off the Insert mode.
> In Simple words, command mode takes user command to perform operations on file and its data like copying, undoing, deleting etc. While insert mode is for typing data

$ rmdir MyProj2
```
This command will delete the MyProj2 folder in the working directory if present or it raises File Not Found Error
> Note : If you try to remove directory using ```rm``` command , then it will raise error saying ```Can't delete <DIR_NAME>: Is a directory``` .
However ```rm``` command can be used to delete directories using ```rm -r <DIR_NAME>``` command.

#### Renaming or Moving a file or directory
```mv``` command is used to rename and move a file
#### syntax
1.  ```mv <file1.extension> <file2.extension>``` : It changes the name of file1 to file2
2.  ```mv <file1.extension> <DIR_NAME>``` : It moves file to directory, if it exists else name changes to dir name
3. ```mv <DIR1> <DIR2>``` : It renames the Directory1 to Directory2, provided there is no Directory with the same name as Directory2
4. ```mv <DIR1> <DIR2>``` : It moves the Directory1 to the Directory2, if it is already present in the main folder.

> It can be said that ```mv A B``` changes A to B, if B is not already in the folder else moves A inside B.
If A and B both are files then A's name is changed to B and original B is deleted (Point to be Noted).
